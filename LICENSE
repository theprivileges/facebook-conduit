    Conduit simply receives events on a particular callback and then republishes these events through an emitter. That's it.

    This stuff is already opinionated in things that don't matter too much. It's trivial to modify any consumers of this code to 
    fix the decisions I've made.

    The first version of this software let you verify your own verify_tokens for both 'unsubscribe' and 'subscribe' separtely.
    I went ahead and decided to do this verification via HMAC with the callback URL and a secret you pass into Conduit.

    Then I had an fairly inflexible way to map figure out "event names" from the incoming callback. This violated a separation-of-concerns
    by making the callback URL map *directly* to what the event was, as it was just a base64-encoded, dash-separated represenation of the 
    subscription info. This fit my app fine, but probably wasn't clear for everyone else. Also, when Neil added parameterized topics (e.g., geo,
    tags, etc), this proved my naive implemenation as hard-to-adapt.

    I've changed this by every callback URL be just a ID with no intrinsic importance and force the application that initiates subscriptions,
    to figure out what this means. Conduit doesn't need to know what this is -- it's just a conduit that just knows that the callback URL has a 
    query parameter called 'sub' that it will publish a parsed Flickr push event to its emitter.

    Also, an oversight in the first version was Conduit automatically refreshing subscriptions even if the person hadn't logged in some time.
    If I haven't received a heartbeat for a user in 10 minutes and I get a subscription request for them, I don't refresh the subscription and
    unset the time last seen.
